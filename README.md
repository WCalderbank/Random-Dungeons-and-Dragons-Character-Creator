# Random-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Character-Creator

In this project I wished to explore the complexities of building a Front-End webpage linked to a Dungeons and Dragons themed API, which would then render and display the fetched data as a randomly generated character at the click of a button. While also allowing myself to express creative choices through use of HTML and CSS manipulation.

- My first project working on my HTML and CSS design whilst incorperating the use of an API.

  - Make sure the FETCH request is linked and then displayed correctly.

  - Work on improving some of the colors when randomly generating the text.
