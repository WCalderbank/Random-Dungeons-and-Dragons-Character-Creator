# Random-Dungeons-and-Dragons-Character-Creator

Front End linked to a D&D API and displayed as a randomly generated character at the click of a button.

- My first project working on my HTML and CSS design whilst incorperating the use of an API.

  - Make sure the FETCH request is linked and then displayed correctly.

  - Work on improving some of the colors when randomly generating the text.
